# BusReservationProject
This is a collaborative project on creating a hassle-free online bus reservation system for the end users
DOMAIN : TRANSPORT

NEED OF THE PROJECT : 
 The traditional approach of pen-and-paper used by many bus transportation systems is both time and money consuming. 
 There is no guarantee of the transactions to be error-free.
 Calculation mistakes in the bill generation and costing.

SOLUTION : Hassle-free task of providing bus reservation at fingertips, wherein the customers can book and cancel bus reservations from anywhere and at any time. The end users will also be able to view and download the journey details.

OBJECTIVE :
Customize the travel company process to manage data, make fast and error-free transactions.
Keep record of the bills so that the customers could keep records of their daily accounts.
Back-up procedures for 100% successful implementation of Bus Reservation System.
User-friendly UI and easy way to search, book and cancel bus tickets.
Create a website for users to claim privileges.
PROJECT FLOW : Once the user logs into the website, he/she can enter source and destination stops, date and time span to avail the appropriate buses. After this they will be provided with the list of buses. After selecting the desired bus, user hits the book ticket button which takes him/her to the payment page.
On unavailability of the bus/tickets, appropriate message will be sent.
The payment page will have options for wallet, net banking, debit card and credit card. the issued tickets can later be printed.
